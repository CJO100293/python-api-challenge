# WeatherPy

The basis for the code used for the value give to the variable "city_data" in the "Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude" section as well as the basis for the code used to Annotate the text for the regression line equation in the "# function for creating the regression scatter plots" section was found from https://github.com/MauroBarron/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/master/WeatherPy.ipynb

The basis for the code found under "# Retrieving current date" within the "Create the Scatter Plots Requested" section was found from https://github.com/poonam-ux/Python_API_WeatherPy_VacationPy/blob/main/WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb

Some of the basis for the code used in the "Define a function to create Linear Regression plots", "# function for setting up Linear regression", "# function for creating the regression scatter plots" and "# function for creating labels and title for the regression scatter plots" was helped with by AskBCS.

# VacationPy

The basis for the code under the "# Adding legend to plot" section for the first plot under "Step 1: Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city." was found from https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/overlay-plots-with-legend/1172

The basis for the code used in the "hover_cols" variable within the "# Configure the map plot" part of the "Step 5: Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map." section was found from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59678780/show-extra-columns-when-hovering-in-a-scatter-plot-with-hvplot
